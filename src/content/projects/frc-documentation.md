### Overview
This project is a comprehensive technical documentation effort for an FRC robotics team, built using a **custom Docusaurus site**. The documentation explains complex robotics systems—most notably coaxial swerve drive—from first principles, with the goal of making advanced systems understandable, maintainable, and extensible by future team members.

Rather than serving as a reference dump, the site is structured as a learning resource that connects theory, implementation, and real-world behavior.

### Motivation
As the lead programmer and student mentor, I was responsible for designing and implementing many of the team’s most complex systems, including swerve drive, autonomous motion, state estimation, and simulation.

Without clear documentation, this knowledge would be lost each season as students graduated. Existing resources were fragmented, outdated, or assumed too much prior knowledge, making onboarding unnecessarily difficult.

### Documentation Scope
The site covers the full robotics software and hardware stack, including:
- Drive train architectures and tradeoffs
- Coaxial swerve drive mechanics and control
- Kinematics and motion profiling
- Odometry and sensor fusion
- Autonomous path planning
- Simulation and testing strategies
- Safety systems and failure modes

Each section builds concepts incrementally, tying mathematical models and control theory directly to physical hardware and observed behavior.

### Site Design and Tooling
The documentation was implemented as a **custom Docusaurus site**, chosen for its support of:
- Structured navigation and versioned content
- Markdown-based authoring for fast iteration
- Embedded diagrams and annotated images
- Long-term maintainability across seasons

The information architecture was intentionally designed to support both quick reference and deep learning, allowing readers to either jump to specific topics or follow a guided progression.

### Teaching and Knowledge Transfer
This documentation became the foundation for:
- Workshops taught to new programmers
- Onboarding materials for future team members
- A senior capstone project focused on teaching robotics programming and electronics

By formalizing system knowledge in a durable, well-organized format, the team can now iterate faster and avoid repeating costly design and implementation mistakes.

### What This Shows
- Treating documentation as a first-class engineering artifact
- Explaining complex technical systems clearly and precisely
- Designing information architecture for long-term maintainability
- Leadership through teaching and technical mentorship
- Using modern documentation tooling to support real engineering teams
