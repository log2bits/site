### Overview
I completed an 8-week full-time software engineering internship at **SmugMug**, working on the **Growth team**. My work spanned both frontend and backend systems and involved contributing to live production code used by millions of users.

This was my first experience working inside a large, mature production codebase, and it gave me hands-on exposure to real engineering processes: sprint planning, code review, QA, testing, and deployment.

---

### Area of Work
- Frontend and backend software development
- Working within a large **monorepo**
- Contributing to **production features and infrastructure upgrades**
- Collaborating with designers, frontend engineers, backend engineers, and QA

---

### Engineering Process & Takeaways
Working at SmugMug exposed me to a highly structured and scalable engineering workflow:

- **Security & layered architecture**  
  Learned how large production systems are structured with multiple layers of validation, review, and protection.

- **Tickets & sprints (Jira)**  
  Used Jira for sprint planning, task allocation, and prioritization in a fast-moving production environment.

- **Git, QA, and PR process**  
  Learned the full lifecycle of a change:
  - Feature development
  - Pull request review
  - QA validation
  - Production deployment

- **Modern + legacy codebases**  
  Gained experience navigating and modifying both modern and legacy systems without breaking existing behavior.

- **Frontend + backend development**  
  Worked across the stack using technologies including **PHP, React, and Next.js**.

- **Sandboxed environments**  
  Used internal sandbox tooling to safely test and validate changes without impacting production systems.

### Impact & Projects
#### Gallery Engagement Stats
- Improved gallery engagement statistics by adding an **update cadence**
- Enabled users to see refreshed photo views and download metrics
- Improved clarity and usefulness of engagement data across galleries

#### Monorepo Frontend Fixes
- Fixed production frontend issues, including resolving **404 routing bugs**
- Learned how small frontend issues propagate in large codebases

#### PHP 8.1 Upgrade Support
- Contributed backend work related to the **PHP 8.1 upgrade**
- Wrote and ran **unit tests** for backend changes
- Worked on changes that had real production impact and release deadlines
- Collaborated closely with backend engineers to ensure stability

---

### What This Experience Gave Me
- First exposure to **real production engineering**
- Comfort working in large, unfamiliar codebases
- Understanding of professional engineering workflows
- Experience balancing speed, safety, and correctness
- Confidence contributing code that affects real users

This internship laid the foundation for how I approach software engineering today: writing careful, testable code and understanding how individual changes fit into large systems.
