## About

I’m a second-year **Computer Science major at UCSC**, originally from Los Altos and currently based in Santa Cruz.

I like building software that’s **fast, visual, and grounded in real systems** - especially when performance and correctness actually matter.

---

### What I enjoy working on

- **Performance & optimization**  
  I enjoy taking something that works and making it *significantly faster*, whether that’s an algorithm, a pipeline, or a system under real constraints.

- **Visual + interactive outputs**  
  Projects are most fun to me when I can *see* what the code is doing.  
  This is what originally drew me to tools like **p5.js**, **computer vision**, and simulation.

- **Graphics & GPU programming**  
  Lately I’ve been learning how computer graphics work at a lower level - shaders, GPU-friendly algorithms, and performance-oriented rendering.

### Hardware & systems curiosity

I enjoy working close to hardware:
- Built my own PC years ago and have continuously upgraded it
- Recently focused on **small form factor builds**, pushing down to a ~**10L case** without major performance tradeoffs
- Interested in how physical constraints shape software decisions

---

### Other technical interests

- **Audio & signal processing**  
  Recently got into EQ, calibration software, and speaker/headphone measurement.  
  Currently thinking about building my own **AutoEQ-style algorithm**.

- **Languages & tools**  
  Learning **Rust** for its performance, safety, and design philosophy.

- **Game development**  
  Active in UCSC’s **GDA (Game Design & Art) club**, learning **Godot** and game systems design.

### How I approach projects

I tend to learn by building things that:
- Produce real output (visuals, data, or hardware interaction)
- Expose performance tradeoffs
- Break in interesting ways if I get something wrong

Right now I’m focused on deepening my understanding of systems, graphics, and performance-oriented software while continuing to build technically ambitious projects.
